Description
- 
I have always wanted to track your daily habits and and wanted to see if there was a connectiom or correlation beteen them?like, for example, if when I eat 6 pieces of pizza my energy level drops the next day and I'm pissed off at the world, or if when I excersize after work am I more likely to sleep well that night and be in a good mood the next day? 

I have looked for an ap out there that allows me to do this digitally, but in my search, I havent been able to find an app quite like the one im looking for that is well designed and easy to use, so, I decided to make one!
